<Center> <h1>About Me</h1></Center>
Hi! My name is Jade and I'm a junior studying ECE and (probably) minoring in robotics.
<li> I think robots and autonomous systems are super cool - in high school I did a lot with FIRST robotics and I'm a member of CUAir and the Organic Robotics Lab here at Cornell<\li>
