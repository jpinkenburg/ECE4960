<Center> <h1>About Me</h1></Center>
Hi! My name is Jade and I'm super excited to take this class! Here are some (hopefully) fun facts about me:
<li> I'm currently a junior studying ECE and minoring in robotics </li>
 
<li> I think robots and autonomous systems are super cool - in high school I did a lot with FIRST robotics and I'm a member of CUAir and the Organic Robotics Lab here at Cornell</li>
 
<li> When I'm not being a stereotypical engineer in the lab, I enjoy playing the keyboard (not the typing kind!), running, hiking, and any sort of adventure I might stumble into</li>
 
<li> I'm trying to learn how to cook and don't consider myself so bad at it, but my smoke detector begs to differ </li>
