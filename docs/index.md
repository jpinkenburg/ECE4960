<h1>About Me</h1></Center>
Hi! My name is Jade and I'm super excited to take this class! Here are some (hopefully) fun facts about me:
<li> I'm currently a junior studying ECE and minoring in robotics </li>
 
<li> I think robots and autonomous systems are super cool - in high school I did a lot with FIRST robotics and I'm a member of CUAir and the Organic Robotics Lab here at Cornell</li>
 
<li> When I'm not being a stereotypical engineer in the lab, I enjoy playing the keyboard (not the typing kind!), running, hiking, and any sort of adventure I might stumble into</li>
 
<li> I'm trying to learn how to cook and don't consider myself so bad at it, but my smoke detector begs to differ </li>

    <h2> <i> The Artemis Board </i></h2> </Center>

<h3 style="color: green;"> Setup </h3>
To be able to program the Artemis board, I first had to configure my Arduino IDE to install the required libraries. After installing everything, I checked that the programmer was functional by uploading the provided 'Blink It Up' program - as shown in the video below, the board exhibited the expected behavior (built in blue LED toggles every second).

<h3 style="color: green;"> Example Programs </h3>
<b> Serial Output: </b> To test if serial communication worked between my laptop and the Artemis board, I uploaded the provided 'Example2_Serial' program. As seen in the video below, the board was able to receive keyboard input from the laptop, process it, and print statements on my screen via the serial interface. The provided example program actually didn't work perfectly because it neglected to take into account the default newline character when sending serial commands, so I had to alter the code slightly to make it run more smoothly.<br>

<b> Analog Tests: </b> To determine if the board is able to measure analog values, I ran the 'Example4_analogRead' program that reads an onboard temperature sensor and prints the output on the Arduino IDE via serial. In the video below, we can see the temperature of the board increase as I hold it close to my overheating laptop. <br>

<b> Microphone Test: </b> To see if the onboard microphone is functional, I uploaded the 'Example1_MicrophoneOuput' program that identifies the loudest frequency heard by the microphone. As seen in the video below, the loudest frequency changes with the pitch of the whistled tone.<br>

<h3 style="color: green;"> Battery Tests </h3>
Another cool feature of the Artemis board is its onboard battery charger. When the LiPo battery is connected to the board while plugged into a laptop via USB-C, the board is able to charge the battery (indicated by the yellow light in the image below). When the board is disconnected from the computer, it is able to source power from the battery; this can be seen in the video below, in which the board turns on the blue built in LED when it detects a tone being whistled. The board determines that a tone is being whistled by identifying the loudest frequency using the microphone, just as was done above; if the pitch was above a certain threshold frequency value, then the light would turn on (this frequency value was determined via trial and error - speaking is at much lower tones than whistling)<br>
<b>Code:</b><br>
```C
if(ui32LoudestFrequency >= 500){digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN,HIGH);}
  else{digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN,LOW);}
```

    <h2> <i> Bluetooth Communication </i></h2> </Center>

<h3 style="color: green;"> Setup </h3>
I had a little trouble setting up the bluetooth on the provided ECE4960 Ubuntu VM, so I just opted to use my windows machine for the entirety of this lab. To enable bluetooth communication with the Artemis board, I installed the necessary python library (bleak) using pip - luckily, I already had python 3 installed on my computer so I didn't have to go through the horrendous process of setting up python on my laptop. I also downloaded the provided distribution code (python scripts and Arduino IDE code) as a starting point for this lab.<br>
Once the necessary libraries were installed and the code was downloaded, I ran the example code to see if my laptop was able to connect to the Artemis board via bluetooth. Luckily, I was able to connect the two after a few tries and added the board's MAC address to the settings cache.

<h3 style="color: green;"> Pinging the Robot </h3>
To start experimenting with the bluetooth communication, I first tried something simple: pinging the Artemis board. To get a response from the board, my laptop first transmits a bluetooth packet that contains a pong command that instructs the Artemis board to send back a response packet upon reception. When the computer receives this response packet ("pong"), the simpleHandler enters the pseudo-switch statement and processes the pong command. To measure the round trip response times and flucutuations in latency, I modified the PONG case as below:
```Python3
timeDiff = time.time() - theRobot.now
instantDat.append(round(timeDiff,5))
if(Settings["pingLoop"]):
    loop.create_task(theRobot.ping())
```
In this code snippet, the program records the time difference between pongs and records it in a python list. When the python script is killed by the user, these python lists are converted to NumPy arrays before the program quits out (this was done because appending to lists is computationally faster than appending to NumPy arrays and I wanted to skew the measurement as little as possible). While a slightly more accurate average may be acquired by only measuring the time every 5 or 10 pings, capturing the round trip time of every ping only adds a few extra commands; since python per-line execution times are on the order of microseconds, this shouldn't skew the data a whole lot - collecting more data points may also give a better idea of the variation in latency. The data I collected was then used to make the following histogram of round trip times: <br>
<img src="reg_histo.png" alt="Regular RT Histogram"><br>
The average round-trip ping time was 0.1185 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.0095 seconds with a total of 500 datapoints collected. Interestingly, the data seems to be bimodal in a sense - the majority of times are centered around ~.1125 seconds, but there's a second significant cluster at around 0.13 seconds. 
This test was performed with the artemis board right next to my laptop. To see how the round-trip time varies with distance, I left the board on my porch and pinged it with my laptop from across the street - results can be seen below: <br>
<img src="dist_histo.png" alt="Distance RT Histogram"><br> 
The average RT ping time in this case was 0.145 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.034 seconds, also with 500 datapoints collected. As with the last trial, the data also seems to be bimodal in a sense (although it's shifted right and a bit less apparent), but the distribution is a fair bit smoother than in the previous. Personally I thought that the bluetooth communication would be a decent bit slower from ~20 ft away, but I was suprised to see that the difference in average RT time did not differ by such a large margin (only about ~0.03 sec slower on average from a distance).

<h3 style="color: green;"> Command Framework Modifications </h3>
Things I did: Added IMU float delivery, PNG Image transmission (still kinda in the works)
